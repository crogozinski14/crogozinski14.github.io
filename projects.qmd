#### Personal Website & Portfolio

This Quarto-based website serves as my personal portfolio, blog, and learning space for web development and data science. Built with Quarto, it is deployed on GitHub Pages and customized using YAML and SCSS.

#### Other Projects

Through the class ESS 330 - Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science at CSU, I have completed several projects including a few GitHub repositories which can be viewed on my GitHub site linked below.

#### Non-point Source Pollution Education

Through my business, Reef Healers, we have launched a project to educate communities on the impacts that inland communities have on ocean health through our connected water - mainly focusing on pollution such as non-point source pollution. We do this through online education, infographics, and hosting local clean-up events.

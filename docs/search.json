    "text": "I am a dedicated professional completing my degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University, with a strong passion for marine ecology. I am certified in coral restoration and have accumulated several hours of hands-on restoration experience. My entrepreneurial work focuses on the interconnectedness of inland and marine ecosystems, with a particular emphasis on raising awareness of how water quality impacts both environments. Since most marine pollutants originate from inland sources, I am committed to promoting sustainable practices that protect water resources and, in turn, marine ecosystems. Through practical and research-based approaches, I aim to advance our understanding and conservation of these vital environments.\n\nCertifications:\nArcGIS Pro Basics - Esri - Issued January 2025\nRMP Coral Restoration Certification - Roatan Marine Park - Issues June 2023\nCommunicating the Value of Biodiversity - UNDP - Issues January 2023\nSMS for Executives - AvMaSSI - Issued August 2021"

Built with Quarto, it is deployed on GitHub Pages and customized using YAML and SCSS.\n\n\nOther Projects\nThrough the class ESS 330 - Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science at CSU, I have completed several projects including a few GitHub repositories which can be viewed on my GitHub site linked below.\nView GitHub Projects: https://github.com/crogozinski14\n\n\nNon-point Source Pollution Education\nThrough my business, Reef Healers, we have launched a project to educate communities on the impacts that inland communities have on ocean health through our connected water - mainly focusing on pollution such as non-point source pollution. We do this through online education, infographics, and hosting local clean-up events."

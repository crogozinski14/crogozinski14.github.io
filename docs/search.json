As the Co-founder and CEO of Reef Healers, I lead conservation, education, and community engagement initiatives that connect inland water action to ocean health.\n\nMy work focuses on the deep connection between water quality, river systems, and coral reef resilience. I am certified in coral restoration and am scuba certified, bringing hands-on restoration experience into my broader mission of protecting ecosystems from mountains to reefs.\n\nI founded Reef Healers to empower inland communities to understand their influence on marine environments and to take meaningful action. Through science-based communication, outreach, and innovation, I aim to build a movement that strengthens water stewardship, supports community resilience, and protects ecosystems across entire watersheds.\n\nEducation:\nAccelerated Professional Science Masters - AMP PSM, Ecosystem Science and Sustainability - Colorado State University - Aug 2025 - Dec 2026\nBachelor of Science - BS, Ecosystem Science and Sustainability - Colorado State University - Aug 2023 - Dec 2025\n\n\nCertifications:\nHuman Research - Group 2.

Built with Quarto, it is deployed on GitHub Pages and customized using YAML and SCSS.\n\n\nOther Projects\nThrough the class ESS 523A - Environmental Data Science Applications for Ecosystem Science at CSU, I have completed several projects, including a few GitHub repositories which can be viewed on my GitHub site linked below.\nView GitHub Projects: https://github.com/crogozinski14\n\nLand Use Regulations on Sensitive Habitats (e.g., barrens) in ColoradoLand Use Regulations on Sensitive Habitats (e.g., barrens) in Colorado\nJan 2025 - May 2025\nThe Colorado Natural Heritage Program (CNHP) monitors the state’s rare and imperiled species and habitats to promote the conservation of Colorado’s valuable biological resources. Our research group had been tasked with developing a classification workflow for barrens to aid in the protection of these vulnerable ecosystems. With pressure from oil and gas industry expansion, it is pertinent that the 2025 State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) includes a clear definition and identification method to ensure uniform understanding across the board in terms of ineligible land for drilling and fracking. With help from CNHP’s existing data and other researched layers, a replicable model for identifying barrens has been initialized to strengthen protection efforts and guide conservation priorities.\n\nModel trial for Alamosa County, CO\n\n\nNon-point Source Pollution Education\nThrough my business, Reef Healers, we have launched a project to educate communities on the impacts that inland communities have on ocean health through our connected water, with a primary focus on non-point source pollution. We do this through online education, infographics, and hosting local clean-up events."

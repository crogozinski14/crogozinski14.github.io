title: "About"
---

I am a dedicated professional completing my degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University, with a strong passion for marine ecology. I am certified in coral restoration and have accumulated several hours of hands-on restoration experience. My entrepreneurial work focuses on the interconnectedness of inland and marine ecosystems, with a particular emphasis on raising awareness of how water quality impacts both environments. Since most marine pollutants originate from inland sources, I am committed to promoting sustainable practices that protect water resources and, in turn, marine ecosystems. Through practical and research-based approaches, I aim to advance our understanding and conservation of these vital environments.

title: "About"
---

I am a Master’s student in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University, specializing in Water Resources. As the Co-founder and CEO of Reef Healers, I lead conservation, education, and community engagement initiatives that connect inland water action to ocean health.\
\
My work focuses on the deep connection between water quality, river systems, and coral reef resilience. I am certified in coral restoration and am scuba certified, bringing hands-on restoration experience into my broader mission of protecting ecosystems from mountains to reefs.\
\
I founded Reef Healers to empower inland communities to understand their influence on marine environments and to take meaningful action. Through science-based communication, outreach, and innovation, I aim to build a movement that strengthens water stewardship, supports community resilience, and protects ecosystems across entire watersheds.
